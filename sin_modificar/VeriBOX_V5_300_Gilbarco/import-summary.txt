ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/android-support-v4.jar => app/libs/android-support-v4.jar
* libs/arm64-v8a/libpos.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libpos.so
* libs/arm64-v8a/libserial_port.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libserial_port.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libpos.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libpos.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libserial_port.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libserial_port.so
* libs/armeabi/libpos.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libpos.so
* libs/armeabi/libserial_port.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libserial_port.so
* libs/bbdevice-android-3.0.3.jar => app/libs/bbdevice-android-3.0.3.jar
* libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-2.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar => app/libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-2.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* libs/x86/libpos.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libpos.so
* libs/x86/libserial_port.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libserial_port.so
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
